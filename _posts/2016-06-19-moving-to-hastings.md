### Moving to Hastings
In July and August of 2016 I will be moving to St. Leonards / Hastings (I do not know what to call it yet). I am moving from South London with my girlfriend Carla and our son Eben. We will be renting a flat on Kenilworth Road. I will be commuting to London for work four or five days a week. Carla will be commuting to London for work one or two days a week. Eben will be going to nursery a few days a week.

##### Leaving London
I have lived in London since, I think 2006, maybe 2007. I used to live in Bath, where I went to university. I moved into a squat that Carla and some other friends had opened up in Stepney Green (Bengal House). Later we moved to Kingsland / Hoxton (Laburnum Court and Girling House). I was squatting for about 18 months. We decided that we needed something more stable and started to rent warehouses as "studios" that we would live in. We have been doing this for about seven years, as a group of between eight and fifteen. Three years ago Carla and I had a baby. We were living in a place in Walthamstow. Last year that place burned down and we moved to Deptford. We cannot really afford to live in London anymore and we need to put Eben on a school list so we are separating from our friends that we have lived with for ages to go and live in a flat. I am pleased and deeply upset. Living communally in strange places is wonderful in lots of ways but it can be difficult in other ways and it all overlaps. Losing our home and all of our possessions in a fire is terrible. So we have to go.

##### Love
One of the reasons that I enjoy living in London is the mixture of people from all over the world and the potential for all of that to form bonds and create love. Carla and our housemate Anna were doing a face-painting stall at a local fayre next to where we lived in Clapton and a boy asked to have TURK painted on one hand and KURD on the other, on his knuckles. I do not know any more about him or his family, or very much at all about the conflicts that exist in Turkey and the surrounding region between Turks and Kurds, but it felt at the time as though London had something to do with what that boy was experiencing. It was happening here and it felt good to be in amongst it.  
I do not think that St. Leonards / Hastings is going to be void of that. I think that there are going to be lots of wonderful things going on. This blog is an excuse for me to go out and try to meet with people and talk with people about these things so that I am not arriving and living there based on my collection of bizarre assumptions.

##### This blog
One of the things that prevents me from writing about anything and that has made it difficult (during many attempts) for me to maintain a blog is that I have no idea what I am writing about or what the purpose of it is. Why have I written this? Is it leading somewhere? Do I have a point? At the moment it does not feel as though it does. It might not need to have a point but if I am going to write then I need to accept that and carry on. I am going to leave it there then and hope that over time something will change and it will seem as though it was worth doing.
